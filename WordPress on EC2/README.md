# WordPress on EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. On a virtual server you can install an Apache web server to host your WordPress website.
